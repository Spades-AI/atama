## Overview

This repository contains a **proof-of-concept** of a reimplementation of the SPL Token program, one of the most used programs on Solana, using [`pinocchio`](https://github.com/febo/pinocchio). The purpose is to have an implementation that optimizes the compute units, while being fully compatible with the original implementation &mdash; i.e., support the exact same instruction and account layouts as SPL Token, byte for byte.

## Features

- `no_std` crate
- Same instruction and account layout as SPL Token
- Minimal CU usage






## Building

To build the programs from the root directory of the repository:
```bash
pnpm install
```
to install the required libraries, then:
```bash
pnpm programs:build
```

## Testing

To run the tests against both versions of the Token program:
```bash
pnpm programs:test
```
